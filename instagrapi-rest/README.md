# Generating client code

You can use [this repo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli) to generate client code for this rest api in any language you want to use.

Exapmle:
`openapi-generator-cli generate -g python -i https://localhost:8000]/openapi.json --skip-validate-spec`
Note `skip-validate-spec` is not necesserily required, when running it on my pc it couldn't validate the spec for some reason.

# Testing

Tests can be run like this:

`docker-compose run api pytest tests.py`

One test:

`docker-compose run api pytest tests.py::test_media_pk_from_code`

or without docker-compose:

`docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/app" instagrapi-rest pytest tests.py`

# Development

For debugging:

`docker-compose run --service-ports api`
